### Install / Setup


### Stack
- Vue


### Learning Goals
The developer was to learn how to use Vue without instruction and help, using only the docs and other resources for reference on where to start, what to do in case of an error, and how to troubleshoot those errors. This is a final project intending to mimic a take-home project during the interview process, therefore the developer was given no lessons about the framework and instructed to work completely solo.
